```{r}

choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)

```

```{r}
# part 1

# number of choco bars in dataset
num_reports = nrow(choco)

num_reports

# bar chart
bar_chart = ggplot(data=choco, aes(x=Review.Date, y=num_reports)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.75, fill="steelblue")+theme_minimal()
bar_chart

```{r}
# part 2

# histogram
mpg_hist = ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating)) + geom_histogram()

mpg_hist = ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1)

mpg_hist

```

Ratings has a mean and median at 3, with a slightly skewed left distribution but an arguement can also be made for a the distribution being symmetric. 

Their is an outlier at a rating of 5. 

```{r}

# scatterplot of cocoa percentage and rating
mpg_scatter = ggplot(choco, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating)) +
    geom_point()
mpg_scatter + geom_jitter()


```

Their is no correlation between cocoa percentage and the rating of the chocolate bars.


```{r}
# scatterplot showing how ratings compare across different company locations?





filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))
```
