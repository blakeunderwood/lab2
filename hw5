```{r}

choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)

```

```{r}
# part 1

# number of choco bars in dataset
num_reports = nrow(choco)

num_reports

# bar chart
bar_chart = ggplot(data=choco, aes(x=Review.Date, y=num_reports)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.75, fill="steelblue")+theme_minimal()
bar_chart

```


```{r}
# part 2

# histogram
mpg_hist = ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating)) + geom_histogram()

mpg_hist = ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1)

mpg_hist

```

Ratings has a mean and median at 3, with a slightly skewed left distribution but an arguement can also be made for a the distribution being symmetric. 

Their is an outlier at a rating of 5. 

```{r}

# scatterplot of cocoa percentage and rating
mpg_scatter = ggplot(choco, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating)) +
    geom_point()
mpg_scatter + geom_jitter()


```

Their is no correlation between cocoa percentage and the rating of the chocolate bars.


```{r}
# varaible making new dataset for top 3 countries with most ratings
var = dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))
# boxplots
ggplot(var, aes(x = Rating, y = Company.Location )) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(
    title = "Chocolate rating for 3 countries",
    x = "Rating",
    y = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

```

Across the the top 3 countries with most ratings, they all have around the same median rating at around 3.2.

Canada and US are both skewed left and have larger varaiances than France which is symmetric and has a much smaller variance.

the US has two outliers, France has one outlier and Canada has no outliers.
